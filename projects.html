			<h2><a href="https://github.com/giannagalard/Real-Estate">House Listing Service</a></h2>
            <pre><code>For many prospective homeowners, the process of finding a potential home 
is complicated. Days spent researching homes for sale, attending open 
houses, and reaching sale agreements can overwhelm these prospective 
homeowners. In essence, not enough information is readily available for 
those looking for a new home or placing their home on the market, making 
the process too indirect.

Our house listing service solves this problem by creating a program where 
users can search homes/apartments for sale and list their homes for sale. 
We also have a signup/sign-in feature, along with an agent search to help 
you get the perfect match to find your forever home. We implemented java 
swing for the GUI to help make the program feel more slick and comfortable.</code></pre>

                <pre><code>We built a program that generates heat maps showing the high-risk areas 
of Staten Island. We also integrated a chatbot named Nurse Joy, who offers 
you the ability to take a questionnaire going over your symptoms. If you 
felt the need to get tested for COVID after chatting with Nurse Joy, we 
offered a list of available COVID testing sites on Staten Island.</code></pre>
